```
' print "Hello World!"
```
> Call to undefined sub 'print'

```
' print("Hello World!")
```
> Call to undefined sub 'print'

```
' print 'Hello World!'
```
> Call to undefined sub 'print'

How can I make `print` work?

```
PRINT "Hello World!"
```
> Hello World!

```
PRINT 'Hello World!'
```

`''` seems to be used for single-line comments.

```
'You can't see what I'm saying.'
