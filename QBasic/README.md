## QBasic Practice

### HelloWorld.bas (2020.02.27)

```QBasic
print "Hello World!"
```
> Call to undefined sub 'print'

```QBasic
print("Hello World!")
```
> Call to undefined sub 'print'

```QBasic
print 'Hello World!'
```
> Call to undefined sub 'print'

How can I make `print` work?

```QBasic
PRINT "Hello World!"
```
> Hello World!

The secret was UPPER CASE!

```QBasic
PRINT 'Hello World!'
```
>
`''` seems to be used for single-line comments.

```QBasic
'You can't see what I'm saying.'
```
