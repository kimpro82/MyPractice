Mother step to the light that's before you
Mother change in the seasons I see
Winter's on the rise
Autumn still in my eyes
Reborn as daylight dies

The night of the longest goodbyes
New life is passing us by

How do we get down the mountain we climb day by day
What do we do when the light that we shine fades away
Fades away

Father saving our places in time
Passing into the sublime
Oh oh father
Life has gone to sleep
Strength through your memory
Silent and so serene

I'm scared of what can not be seen
But I'll see you again in between

How do we get down the mountain we climb day by day
What do we do when the light that we shine fades away
We leave the prayers and confessions behind, day by day
Waiting on fate to bring something divine and be saved
And be saved

How do we get down the mountain we climb day by day
What do we do when the light that we shine fades away
We leave the prayers and confessions behind, day by day
Waiting on fate to bring something divine and be saved
And be saved

Day by day you get by
Day by day you get by
Day by day you get by
Day by day you get by
