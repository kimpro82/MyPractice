## [Hello World (2022.07.17)](#list)

- I heard some hearsay that **Dart** is almost like **C**, and whose app framework **Flutter** performs as well as native languages.
- Hmm but `import 'package:flutter/material.dart';` doesn't run on **Repl.it**!

#### `HelloWorld.dart`
```dart
// import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
	print('Hello World!');
}
```
